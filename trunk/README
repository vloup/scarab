Welcome to Scarab!

We appreciate your deciding to try Scarab out and appreciate constructive 
feedback on your success (or failure...we hope not!) in getting the 
system running.

For a quick installation guide use the file INSTALL in this
directory. Note that a great deal of relevant information can be found in
the installation guide (see next section).

We highly recommend, that you read the on-line installation guide at

    http://scarab-gen.tigris.org/nonav/HEAD/howto/build-howto.html

If you have Maven installed, you can alternatively generate the
documentation set locally as follows:

    1.) Unpack the installation (you probably already did this)
    2.) go to the installation root
    3.) call maven:

        maven xdoc:transform

The documentation set will be generated to

   $SCARAB_ROOT/target/docs
   
The installation guide an be found at the location:

   $SCARAB_ROOT/target/docs/howto/build-howto.html

It is best to always consult the issue tracking system at

    <http://scarab.tigris.org/issues.html>

However, here are a couple of known issues that you should expect
things to not work or be difficult...

#1. Oracle database creation to a fresh schema fails when ant tries
    to delete non-existent tables prior to creating them.

#2. Oracle 8i support is broken. Oracle 9i should work fine.

#3. You may still have some problems working with Oracle. Please let
    us know if you encounter anything, however, we don't promise to fix
    it right away unless you send real patches that conform to our
    desire to have transparent cross database support (ie: don't send us
    Oracle specific changes).

#4. Microsoft SQL Server requires you to edit the SQL scripts after 
    generating them in the /target directory.  

    - Change all BIGINT's to INT's 
      and all TEXT AND IMAGE to VARCHAR(2000) columns.  
    - Make sure to use whole word matching as some of the column 
      names have the word "TEXT" in them.  
    - Additionally you need to put the various MSSQL drivers in 
      the /lib directory.
    - For more information see http://scarab.tigris.org/mssql.html
