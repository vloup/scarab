          <td>war:inplace</td>
          <td>
            Compiles all the Scarab docs into /src/webapp/ so that you can do inplace development of Scarab.  You do need to compile the Torque OM objects first via running "ant" in the /build directory.
            Unit tests are NOT run as part of this goal.

        <tr>
          <td>clean</td>
          <td>
            Does an extensive clean of directories.  Cleans out any work files generated by Tomcat in /tomcat, deletes /src/webapp/WEB-INF/classes and /src/webapp/WEB-INF/conf, and otherwise returns the source tree to normal.
          </td>
        </tr>          
        <tr>
          <td>scarab:sample</td>
          <td>
            Produces a Windows .exe installable version of Scarab with an embedded Tomcat and Hypersonic Database.  This is meant as a quick resource for people to use to get started with Scarab.  Compiles everything to /target/dist.  Requires that you have <a href="http://nsis.sf.net">NSIS</a> installed.
