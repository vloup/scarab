<section name="How To Build Scarab Docs">
<p>
	The Scarab documenation is written using both xdoc and docbook formats.  This documentation is 
	generated by  <a href="http://maven.apache.org">Maven</a>.  If you haven't used Maven before, 
	follow the <a href="http://maven.apache.org/start/index.html">Getting Started</a> directions.
</p>

	<subsection name="Generating Maven Managed Docs">
	<p>
	Documentation should all be written in the xdoc format, and stored under the /xdocs directory.  When you
	are ready to generate the documentation, you can run Maven's site generation goal via: <source>maven site</source>
	If you don't want to bother to run the unit tests, then run: <source>maven site -Dmaven.test.skip=true</source>
	This will generate all the site documentation, as well as the FAQ, Javadocs, and various code analysis reports in the directory /target/docs.
	</p>
	<p>So far so good, but: For compatibility reasons maven site plugin cannot handle the docs if velocity version is set to any wrong version.
	It is recommended to use 1.5 here. See documentation site for maven xdoc plugin, too. Problem is: Scarab uses another version of velocity,
	as it is good for the xdoc plugin. This is why another important build property named: maven.velocity.version, exists. 
	To build the docs properly you have to set this property manually: <source>maven site -Dmaven.velocity.version=1.5</source> or use an adapted batch script.

	<subsection name="Used Plugins">
	<p>
	We use a Tasks plugin from <a href="http://maven-plugins.sourceforge.net/maven-tasks-plugin/">Maven-Plugins</a>
	to generate the roadmap document.  This plugin should download automatically and install.  If not, look at the
	directions <a href="http://maven-plugins.sourceforge.net/installing.html">here</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
	We use a Findbugs plugin from <a href="http://maven-plugins.sourceforge.net/maven-findbugs-plugin/">Maven-Plugins</a>
	to look for common errors.  This plugin should download automatically and install.  If not, look at the
	directions <a href="http://maven-plugins.sourceforge.net/installing.html">here</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
	We use a StatCVS plugin from <a href="http://statcvs-xml.berlios.de/">StatCVS</a>
	to generate statistics on CVS.  This plugin should download automatically and install.  It requires CVS executable
	to be in your path.  If you have TortoiseCVS installed on windows, then just add that directory to your path!  The
	CVS.exe in the TortoiseCVS directory works fine.
