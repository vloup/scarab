/**
 * The Notification Manager is meant to be the central service to provide notifications
 * related with the usual flow of activities in Scarab.
 * It has essentially two functions:
 * <ul>
 * <li>To allow the system to <b>create notifications</b> regarding activity in the issues.</li>
 * <li>To process the notifications so that they arrive to the involved users.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The simpler notification manager implementation might directly send emails to the involved users in
 * the moment the notifications are created.<br/>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A slightly improved implementation will be able to:
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>Filter the events</b> to decide if each involved user should be notified or not (basing the decision
 * on user-preferences, globa-preferences, whatever...</li>
 * <li><b>Aggregate pending notifications</b> (probably consolidating on issue and user to be notified) so the
 * user will only get one notification for every bunch of changes done in an issue (at least in a given
 * interval of time)</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * The real implementation of this interface to be
 * instantiated is defined by scarab.notificationmanager.classname property
 * (defaults to ScarabNotificationManager)<br>
 * This interface also holds the
 * constants defining the different types of events in the system.
