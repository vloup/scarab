Athough the MySQL-4.1 compatible drivers are under GPL (Gnu Public License)
they may be safely distributed together with Scarab due to the FLOSS document
published from MySQL-AB at

    http://www.mysql.com/company/legal/licensing/foss-exception.html

Below we have added an Email correspondence between Hussayn and MySQL AB, 
from which we have been convinced, that the delivery of the drivers does 
not violate our license policies.

Yea I'm afraid you misunderstood.
The above paragraph just says that any code that we intend to be covered
by the FLOSS exception have a notice about it in their files, next to
the usual GPL reference. It's about *our* source code files.
Right now, the FLOSS exception only applies to the MySQL client C API
library. Which is what you needed. So all is well!

Arjen.
