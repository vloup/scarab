<section name="Tuning Scarab">
<p>
	Run Scarab in production is very different then Scarab in test.  Below are some tips.
</p>
<subsection name="Web Context Changes">
<p>
Change the tomcat context tag so that reloadable=false.  Or, alternatively, change it to true, but
set the checkInterval to a larger number like 180.
</p>
</subsection>

<subsection name="TurbineResources Changes">
<p>
You should change the TurbineResources.properties parameters so that velocity templates don't
auto-reload.  Set scarab.template.cache=TRUE to have caching turned on.
</p>
</subsection>

<subsection name="Tuning the cache">
<p>
Scarab cache is central in the user experience of performance.
You might want to take a look at the cache configuration file in:
<pre>src/conf/classes/cache.ccf</pre>

There you can tweak the number of objects (MaxObjects) of every type that will be kept in memory.
<ul>
<li>Module: If your instance is known to be limitated to a given number of modules, this should get a similar
range.</li> 
<li>ScarabUser: Must be an aproximation to the maximum concurrent number of users.</li>
<li>Issue: A minimum equivalent to the ScarabUser's would be fine. Maybe something more, to keep a performance margin.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<b>Keep in mind: The greatest the size of the cache, the better performance AND the greater memory needs.</b>
