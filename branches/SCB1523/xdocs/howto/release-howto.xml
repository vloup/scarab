	Basically you need to test and build the distribution, and 
	then build and commit the generated documentation.  
</p>
	<subsection name="Building a Distribution">
	<p>
      Make sure your working copy has no local modifications and is 
	  up-to-date. Starting with a fresh copy is recommended.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Build and execute tests.
      <source>
        maven
        maven scarab:create-db
        maven test
      </source>
	</p>

	<p>
      Fix any failures or errors and commit the changes.
	</p>

	<p>
      Check out a fresh copy of Scarab.
      <source>
        svn co http://svn.collab.net/repos/scarab/trunk scarab
      </source>	
	</p>

	<p>
	  Edit scarab/xdocs/scarab_properties.xml and change the 
      property with name "version". Remove the "-dev" appendix from
      the final version number for the release.
	</p>

    <p>
      Run the property file generator and update the www/repository:
      <source>
      maven scarab:update-repo
      maven scarab:update-properties
      </source>
    </p>
	
	<p>
	  Update the scarab/www/index.html file to announce the new release.
	</p>

	<p>
      Update the scarab/xdocs/changes.xml document to set the release
      date for the version. Create a new section for the next release.
	</p>	

	<p>
      Check both the default.properties and index.html and changes.xml files back into CVS.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Tag svn with the release tag. Mail the dev@scarab mailing list to
      let people know that they should hold off on commits until the message
      comes through that you are done with the tag/release process.
      Change the version number in the example below to the version of the 
      current release.	
      <source>
        svn copy http://svn.collab.net/repos/scarab/trunk http://svn.collab.net/repos/scarab/tags/SCARAB_1_0_A
	  </source>	    
	</p>

</subsection>
<subsection name="Release">

	<p>
	  Build a source release. 
      This will create a .tar.gz and a .zip file in
      the scarab directory.
      <source>
        cd scarab/build
        ant package
      </source>	       
	</p>

	<p>
	  Build the All In One Scarab release. This will create a 
	  Windows executable file that people can run in /target/ directory.
      <source>
         maven scarab:sample
      </source>	       
	</p>

	Edit scarab/build/default.properties and change the 
    version number from the final version number  to the next version with a -dev
    suffix and check this file back into CVS.  Also do the same to the project.xml file as well.
