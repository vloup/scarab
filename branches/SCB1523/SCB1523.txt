=============================

Developed by Stephen Reindl.

Done: 
+ Information has been printed only in case verbose level has been set > 2 (fixed)
+ In case of unset linenumber (-1) the linenumber will be ommited. (enh.)
+ The retrieval of information messages returned the warnings instead (fixed)

ToDo:
+ class/member documentation (bug)
+ reporting on maven console in case output goes into file. (enh)
+ suppress zero messages (i.e. Errors: 0) (enh)
+ fix other (yet unknown bugs :-))
