Welcome to Scarab!

We appreciate your deciding to try Scarab out and appreciate constructive 
feedback on your success (or failure...we hope not!) in getting the 
system running.

For a quick installation guide use the file INSTALL in this
directory. Note that a great deal of relevant information can be found in
the installation guide in the documents section:

We highly recommend, that you first read the installation guide in the 
documents section. You can find a ready made version at

    http://www.memocomp.de/scarab/1.0.22/

Alternatively you can generate the documentation set locally as follows.
Note: you will need Maven installed on your box:

    1.) Unpack the installation (you probably already did this)
    2.) go to the installation root
    3.) call maven:

        maven xdoc:transform

The full documentation set will be generated to

   $SCARAB_ROOT/target/docs
   
The installation guide can be found at the location:

   $SCARAB_ROOT/target/docs/howto/build-howto.html

It is best to always consult the issue tracking system at

    http://www.solitone.org/scarab/issues

However, here are a couple of known issues that you should expect
things to not work or be difficult...

#1. Oracle support is broken in this release.
    You may try it out and help us fixing the problems related to the
    oracle integration. Please let us know of any progress. Your help
    will add significant value to Scarab. if you encounter anything, 
    however, we don't promise to fix it right away unless you send real
    patches that conform to our desire to have transparent cross database
    support (ie: don't send us Oracle specific changes).

#2. Scarab works reliably only when cookie are enabled in your browser.

#3. Microsoft SQL Server requires you to edit the SQL scripts after 
    generating them in the /target directory.  

    - Change all BIGINT's to INT's 
      and all TEXT AND IMAGE to VARCHAR(2000) columns.  
    - Make sure to use whole word matching as some of the column 
      names have the word "TEXT" in them.  
    - Additionally you need to put the various MSSQL drivers in 
      the /lib directory.
    - For more information see http://scarab.tigris.org/mssql.html
