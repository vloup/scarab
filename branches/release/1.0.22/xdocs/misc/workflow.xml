Since b20, Scarab provide a default workflow implementation that provides the following features
<ul>
<li>State transitions' workflow: Allows the definition of transition-paths between values of optionlists
attributes, both fixed or conditionally enabled</li>
<li>Conditionally required attributes: Allow any attribute to be required <em>if</em> a given condition is true.</li>
<li>Blocking conditions applied to transitions: You can define when an issue type will "block"
the issues that are defined to be "blocked by" it, and how being "blocked" will affect to the
transitions enabled in a given moment for an issue.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Scarab's configuration of the workflow system is still pluggable, so you can
extend or replace the system with your own if you need to integrate with an external system.
For example, someone has started developing an integration with WmfOpen
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=961620&amp;group_id=76143&amp;atid=546206">
