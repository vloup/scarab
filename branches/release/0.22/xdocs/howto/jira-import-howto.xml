<section name="Instructions">
<p>You'll need a recent version of scarab (0.22 or trunk after 2008 'april) with the JIRA templates installed. Upgrading from a previous version won't install these JIRA templates!</p>
<ul>
<li>Add attribute option values to all global option-type attributes. Then add these to the same attributes in the global issue types.</li>
<li>Add all users. (Alternative here is to set in build.properties scarab.import.addNewUsers=true [see the ScarabIssues.addUsers field]. This will create all the users the import process comes across on-the-fly.)</li>
<li>Add all the modules, adding the JIRA attributes to each. Remove the JIRA prefix from them at the same time. (If you will only have one module you can just rename the JIRA module, remembering to add the attribute options from the first step to each issue type).</li>
<li>Download the issues in xml format from your JIRA installation to your machine. Search and Replace all issue id prefixes so they contain only the four characters your scarab module uses. Eg SEARCH-311 must become SKER311 if your Search module has a code of SKER.</li>
<li>Mangle other data in the xml. For example removing customfields you won't be using any more after the import.</li>
<li>Go to the import xml issues under modules in the left navigation menu. Select the xml file, choose Import type: JIRA. Hit submit.</li>
<li>Most likely you forgot an attribute option or user and you'll see errors accordingly. Fix 'em and repeat last step.</li>
</ul>
