Welcome to Scarab!

We appreciate your deciding to try Scarab out and appreciate constructive 
feedback on your success (or failure...we hope not!) in getting the 
system running.

For a quick installation guide use the file INSTALL in this
directory. Note, many relevant informations are only found in
the installation guide (see next section).

We highly recommend, that you read the online installation guide at

    http://scarab-gen.tigris.org/nonav/HEAD/howto/build-howto.html

If you have Maven installed, you can alternatively generate the
documentation set locally as follows:

    1.) Unpack the installation (you probably already did this)
    2.) go to the installation root
    3.) call maven:

        maven xdoc:transform


The documentation set will be generated to

   $SCARAB_ROOT/target/docs
   
The installation guide an be found at the location:

   $SCARAB_ROOT/target/docs/howto/build-howto.html

Building Scarab on standard Win32 systems could be made easier and 
more failsafe. Volunteers to help with this effort are appreciated. 
Below are some notes that you will need to take into consideration 
when attempting to build Scarab. These notes do not apply to building 
Scarab on Unix systems.

* We highly recommend that you install cygwin instead of using 
  the .bat files. The reason is that our primary focus is currently 
  on Unix systems and not on running Scarab on Win32 systems. 
  Volunteers to port shell scripts and keep things up to date 
  are appreciated.

  You find the cygwin package at

    <http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/>

It is best to always consult the issue tracking system at

    <http://scarab.tigris.org/issues.html>

However, here are a couple of known issues that you should expect
things to not work or be difficult...

#1. Oracle database creation to a fresh schema fails when ant tries
    to delete non-existent tables prior to creating them.

#2. Oracle 8i support is broken. Oracle 9i should work fine.

#3. You may still have some problems working with Oracle. Please let
    us know if you encounter anything, however, we don't promise to fix
    it right away unless you send real patches that conform to our
    desire to have transparent cross database support (ie: don't send us
    Oracle specific changes).

#4. The user administration screens are buggy, badly coded and need to
    be completely redone.

#5. Microsoft SQL Server requires you to edit the SQL scripts after 
    generating them in the /target directory.  

    - Change all BIGINT's to INT's 
      and all TEXT AND IMAGE to VARCHAR(2000) columns.  
    - Make sure to use whole word matching as some of the column 
      names have the word "TEXT" in them.  
    - Additionally you need to put the various MSSQL drivers in 
      the /lib directory.
    - For more information see http://scarab.tigris.org/mssql.html

Creating and populating the database
------------------------------------

The ant build has a target called "create-db" that is normally used to 
create and populate the scarab database. Unfortunately, for a  variety 
of reasons this does not work with PostgreSQL. Instead there is a shell
script that can be used to perform the same job:

    <install dir>/src/sql/create-db.sh. 
    
Here are the steps you should follow:

1. If you are on Windows, download and install Cygwin. Alternatively, 
   convert the shell script to a batch file.

2. Ensure that 'psql', 'createdb' and 'dropdb' are in your path.

3. From <install dir>/build, run 'ant sql-current-db'.

3. 'cd' to <install dir>/src/sql.

4. Ensure that you have set these build properties correctly:

       ${scarab.database.name}
       ${scarab.database.admin.username}
       ${scarab.database.host}
       ${scarab.database.port}
   
5. run one of the two commands below depending of your database admin
   needs a password or not:

       create-db.sh
       create-db.sh --password
    
   This will create the database using the information you supplied
   as ant build properties.
   
   You can also override the default connection values using the 
   command line arguments. More details about the various options can be 
   found by running
   
       createdb.sh --help

Once you complete these steps, you'll be able to run Scarab against 
the newly created database.

--------------------
Database permissions
--------------------

Things get a little tricky if you create the database with one user, and
then Scarab connects as a different user. The problem is one of database
permissions: Scarab requires full rights to all the tables in the Scarab
database. Unfortunately, it seems that the permissions can only be 
granted on a per-table basis. There may be a script in the future that 
helps update the table permissions, but for now it has to be done 
manually.

Of course, if Scarab connects as the user that created the database, 
you won't have this problem at all!
