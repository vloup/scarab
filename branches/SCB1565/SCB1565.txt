SCB1565: Creation and Last Modification date and users in Query Results
======================================================

This issue intends to allow the search results to inform the data and users of first
and last activities on every issue.

Prior to this development, the creation transaction (activityset) was already stored in the issue as
a FK, so this info can be recovered from the database using an additional inner join.

To ease getting the info of the last activity, issue table will be expanded to include also the FK to
the last activityset on every issue, and we'll use the same method to get the info.

== Layout ==

The *easy* way is to show the new attributes as fixed columns in the search results, but adding *four*
new columns to this report might be overkill, and users are not necessariliy wanting this information.
(Anyway, a first step implementation will probably show the info that way)

The *good* way is to allow the four new fields to be selected for the view as if they were *normal*
attributes. Also, sorting should be enabled on this columns.

== Status ==

+ The query already asks for the new fields.
+ SCARAB_ISSUE already has the new LAST_TRANS_ID foreign key.
+ Every activity updates the LAST_TRANS_ID field.

- Migration script; can it include a script to populate initial values for LAST_TRANS_ID?
- Fields are  (still!) not selectable nor sortable
- It's only been implemented only in the web view (it's also needed in Excel/CSV exports!)
