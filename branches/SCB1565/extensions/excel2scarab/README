This ant build transforms an XML input file with 'flat' structure into an XML
importable by Scarab via the Admin-Import XML feature.

The input XML structure can be exported from Microsoft Excel (or others tools??) using the
issues.xsd file slightly customized to define your data structure.

Initial work provided by Matthew James Easlea. Thanks Matthew!

Usage instructions

	0) input.xml will be the input file. scarabimport.xml will be the generated output.
	
	1) Adapt 'issues.xsd' file so it matches the definition of your issues (look at the
	   sample excel.xml and how it relates to the 'CUSTOMIZE HERE' section of issues.xsd)
	   
	2) Make sure the two first elements of every issue in input.xml are are 'Issue_ID'
	   and 'Issue_Type':
           ...
           <issues>
             <issueList>
               <issue>
                 <Issue_ID>1</Issue_ID>
                 <Issue_Type>Defect</Issue_Type>
                 ...
				
	3) Configure the excel2scarab.properties file.
	
	4) Just run 'ant' from the directory containing this file. You'll get a file named
	   'scarabimport.xml' that should be importable in Scarab using Admin-Import XML.
	
Getting input.xml from an Excel sheet

	If you want to prepare data you have in an Excel file, follow this instructions (feature
	depends on Excel 2003).
	
    # Prepare your Excel sheet so it has a row for every issue, and a column for every attribute
      to load.
        * First two columns must be 'Issue_ID' and 'Issue_Type'. First will be the issue ID, and
          second the issuetype name to be loaded in Scarab's module (Defect, Patch, whatever...)

	#  Assign the issue.xsd file to the spreadsheet
        * Use menu: Data -> XML -> XML Source...
        * Add in the issues.xsd (this is the schema that you will map columns in excel to)

    # ensure the blue bordering box covers all rows.
    # goto data->xml->export menu and save to a file called 'input.xml'
