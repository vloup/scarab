README for l10-checking:

This tool is intended to analyse if the language resource files are complete and
error free.

This is done by reading the reference file (i.e. the english file) and compare
all other language files against this file if all needed translations
are there.

OUTPUT:
=======
At first the output describes the problems occured during reading of the 
reference file. This output might look like this:

Following to this all files that are part of the filelist to be used are read
and checked against the reference file:

An example output might look like this:

HOW TO USE:
============

The l10n inspector is run as an ant task that can be used even inside of maven.

A task defition might look like this:

        <ant:taskdef
            name="checkLocaleBundles" 
            classname="org.tigris.scarab.util.build.AntL10AnalysisTask" >
            <ant:classpath>
            	<ant:pathelement location="${maven.build.dir}/classes" />
            	<ant:path refid="maven.dependency.classpath" />
            </ant:classpath>
        </ant:taskdef>

The call itself would look like this:

	<ant:checkLocaleBundles
        	refFile="${maven.src.dir}/conf/classes/ScarabBundle_en.properties"
        	verbose="1"
        	outfile="localeerrs.log"
        	>
            <ant:fileset dir="${maven.src.dir}/conf/classes" >
            	<include name="**/ScarabBundle_??.properties"/>
                <exclude name="**/ScarabBundle_en.properties"/>
            </ant:fileset>
            
            <ant:messageSet error="IllegalPattern" severity="ERROR" />
            ...
        </ant:checkLocaleBundles>

The following attributes are taken into coinsideration:

	refFile (mandatory):
		The reference file to check all localisations against
		
	verbose:
		The level of verbosity. The following values are defined:
		
		0	Only errors are displayed (default)
		1	Errors and warnings are displayed
		2	All informations (including errors and warnings) are
			displayed
			
	outfile:
		The file to write the output to. If this parameter is not given,
		all output is written to ant standard output (i.e. log).
	
The intput to the task is given by using the standard ant filesets:

    <ant:fileset dir="${maven.src.dir}/conf/classes" >
     	<include name="**/ScarabBundle_??.properties"/>
        <exclude name="**/ScarabBundle_en.properties"/>
    </ant:fileset>

You should exclude the reference file because errors are already displayed 
while reading the file.

As a default, all issues are defined as to be ignored. To assign an issue to a 
specific severity, the messageSet element has to be used. It takes two 
attributes: 

	error		The issue to set the severity for

	severity	The severity level. The following levels are defined: ERROR,
				WARNING, INFORMATION, IGNORED (default)

ISSUES
======

The following issues are defined:

* CantParseLine
	"Cannot parse line ''{0}''"
	
	This error is displayed if there's a line that does not represent a valid 
	line in a property file.

  	Example:
  	
  		a=b
  	==>	This is an invalid line
  		c=d

* DefinedTwiceDiff (only in reference file)
	"Key {0} defined twice with different value (first at line {1})"
	
	This error is displayed in case you defined the same key twice with 
	different definitions.
	
	Example:
	
		a=b
	==>	a=d

* DefinedTwice (reference only)
	"Key {0} defined twice (first at line {1})"
	
	This error is displayed in case you defined the same key twice with 
	same definitions.
	
	Example:
	
		a=b
	==>	a=b

* DifferentAttributeCount (localisation only)
	"Key {0} contains different number of attributes ({1}) than reference ({2})"
	
	This error is produced in case the number of arguments is different in the
	reference and the localisation.
	
	Example:
	
		Reference:
			a={0} should be {1}
	
		Localisation:
			a={0} sollte {1} sein, Standart ist {2}
		
* IllegalPattern
	"Key {0} contains an illegal pattern"
	
	This error is created if an attribute in the string is invalid
	
	Example:
		a=This is invalid {1
		
* NotInReference (localisation only)
	"Key {0} not defined in reference"
	
	This error is created if an attribute in the locatisation file does not
	exist in the reference file
	
	Example:
		Reference:
			ComplexName=Definition
			
		Localisation:
		
		==>	CompleName=Translation
		
	Remark:
		In case the severity of "TranslationMissing" is set to a value 
		different to "IGNORE", another message is displayed.

* NoTransAllowed (localisation only)
	"Key {0} is not supposed to be translated"
	
	A key has been marked as not to be translated in the recerence file
	
	Example:
		Reference:
			#-TRANS
			copyright=&copy; (2001-2005) CollabNET Inc.
		
		Localisation:
		==>	copyright=&copy; (2005) Famous hacker Inc.
	
* NotTranslated (localisation only)
	"Key {0} has not been translated"
	
	A key in the reference file has not been translated in the 
	localisation but is present.
	
	Example:
		Reference:
			a=b
		
		Localisation:
		==>	a=b

* TranslatedTwice (localisation only)
	"Key {0} defined twice (first at line {1})"
	
	The key described here is defined twice (or more) in the 
	localisation file.
	
	Example:
		a=b
		...
		a=b

* TranslatedTwiceDiff (localisation only)
	"Key {0} defined twice with different values (first at line {1})"

	The key described here is defined twice (or more) with different 
	descriptions in the localisation file.
	
	Example:
		a=b
		...
		a=c
	
* TranslationMissing
	"Key {0} is missing in localisation"
	
	A key in the reference file is not present in the
	localisation file.
	
	Example:
		Reference:
			a=b
		
		Localisation:
			# a=b
	
* TranslationRequired
  	"Key {0} has to be translated"
  	
  	A key in the reference file has been marked as to be translated
  	in in the refence file and is missing in the localisation file:
  	
  	Example:
  		Reference:
  			#+TRANS
  			TranslationAuthor=Scarab Team
  		
  		Localisation:
  			TranslationAuthor=Scarab Team

All issues are defined as classes in org.tigris.scarab.util.build.l10nchecker.issues

REFERENCE FILE PARAMETERS:
==========================

There are two options to prevent (or force) a key to be translated:

By putting a comment #+TRANS before a key you force the translator to 
translate this key. If you do not translate this key, an error will be
printed.

In case you put a #-TRANS one line before a key, you force the translator
NOT to translate the appropriate key.

Examples:

#+TRANS
Translator= Stephen Reindl <sreindl@triobit.de>
#-TRANS
Copyright= (C) 2005 CollabNet. All rights reserved.

LANGUAGE FILE PARAMETERS:
==========================

You can choose to keep a key in the language bundle with the same value
that the reference language, but don't want it to be listed as an error, because
the value should be the same. In those cases, you can use the #-TRANS key in
the language file:

Examples:

#-TRANS
Error=Error   # The same value than in english
