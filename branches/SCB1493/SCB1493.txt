Implementation of SCB1493 (Internal storing of date attributes).
===============================================================

http://www.solitone.org/scarab/issues/id/SCB1493

Open point:
 * When the date fields are used in the Advanced Search Form, the query gets lost and sorting/selecting attributes does not work ???

Second wave changes:
 * DateAttribute values are now indexed by Lucene, and this fields can be searched.
 * Advanced query form allow ranges for Date attributes.

Features committed in r9566 (already merged in trunk):
 * Dates are now stored in yyyyMMddHHmmssSS format.
 * Allows sorting on date attributes
 * Isolates user's locale and internal format.

Changes:
 * DateAttribute contains now some functions to make the conversions between internal and presentation date formats.
 * Presentation of date attribute is "formatted" (ViewIssueTab1.vm, IssueList.vm, GlobalMacros.vm, IssueListExport.java)
 * Entering of issues has been changed to reformat date values (ReportIssue.java & ModifyIssue.java)
