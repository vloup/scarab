Implementation of SCB1493 (Internal storing of date attributes).
===============================================================

http://www.solitone.org/scarab/issues/id/SCB1493

Features:
 * Dates are now stores in yyyyMMddHHmmssSS format.
 * Allows sorting on date attributes
 * Isolates user's locale and internal format.


Open points:
 * DateAttribute values don't seem to be indexed by Lucene, even though they
are defined as "extends StringAttribute".
 * Search forms don't behave nicely with DateAttributes. This should be improved (not a stopper, because it does not imply any data conversion)

Changes:
 * DateAttribute contains now some functions to make the conversions between internal and presentation date formats.
 * Presentation of date attribute is "formatted" (ViewIssueTab1.vm, IssueList.vm, GlobalMacros.vm, IssueListExport.java)
 * Entering of issues has been changed to reformat date values (ReportIssue.java & ModifyIssue.java)
