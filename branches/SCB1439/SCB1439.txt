SCB1439
=======

This issue provides security restrictions at the AttributeGroup level, associateing a Role the user will need to be able to even see the existance of the AttributeGroup.

Doubts:
- Youngho Cho has asked the issue to require a Permission instead of a Role. Though I tried coding it (and it was even easier), my sensation is that Permission is too coupled to the IU and code, and that Role's are easier to manage, though maybe a slight twist of its originally intended functionalty.

Impact
======

* AttributeGroupEdit.vm and action, AttributeGroup table and om: Include the role list, and hold the required role in the table.
* Security: Affected attributes (those belonging to a restricted attributegroup) will have to remain hidden when:
   - Exported (XML, Excel, CSV, ...)
   - Queried
   - Showed in the history tab
   - Emailed on activity
   - ...

Status
======

+ Seems to work fine when entering and modifyng issues, and the restriction apply also to Queries (and Excel / CSV).
+ History tab currently does not show the restricted attributes.
- Needs to be tested the XML Export security (maybe this is not a problem, because it's more an Admin feature????)
- Needs to be refactored the code that decides if a given field should be showed to a given user or not.
- Emailed activity is a problem when personnel with diverse role sets is assigned to the same issue...
