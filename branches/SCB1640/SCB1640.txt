SCB1640: Allow delete issue
===========================

Change to allow a user with "Issue | Delete" permission to mark issues as 'Deleted'.
Any dependency of this issue is also marked 'deleted', and the notifications are sent.

Changes in the schema: Added a new field 'Moved' because this meaning was stored
in the existing 'Deleted' field, now used exclusively for this meaning.

A new permission 'Issue | Delete' is added in the TURBINE_PERMISSION table and
in PermissionMappings.

Added some refactoring to the ViewIssue.vm template, placing the logic of deciding
if the issue is deleted, inexistent or moved in the screen class.

Pending:
* A confirmation screen, or even a javascript confirm box.
* No migration script provided (still). Just add the moved field to make it work.
