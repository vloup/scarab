It is best to always consult the issue tracking system at

    <http://scarab.tigris.org/>

However, here are a couple of known issues that you should expect
things to not work or be difficult...

#1. Oracle import of the scarab-default-data.sql file will fail
    with some date formatting issues. There is lots of discussion on
    the mailing list about how to fix this. Read the archives.

#2. Oracle 8i support is broken. Oracle 9i should work fine.

#3. You may still have some problems working with Oracle. Please let
    us know if you encounter anything, however, we don't promise to fix
    it right away unless you send real patches that conform to our
    desire to have transparent cross database support (ie: don't send us
    Oracle specific changes).

#4. The user administration screens are buggy, badly coded and need to
    be completely redone.
