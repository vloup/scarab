		<simpara>The default target, deploy, is used to generate the code of the OM (Object Mapping) classes and to compile and build the Scarab application.</simpara>
		<simpara>The second main target, create-db, is used to create and initialize the Scarab database. It does this by calling the second ant build file, described in the second section. </simpara>
		<simpara>The target dependency graph below may help you visualize how targets are related to each other and the order in which they are called.</simpara>
