SCB1445: scarab does not cooperate well with MySQL 4.1.x
========================================================

Status:

 Seems like trunk at r9551 works fine if the old driver (mm.mysql*.jar) is removed, the project cleaned and rebuilt, and the new driver (mysql-connector-3.0.10-stable-bin.jar) is used.
 Foreign constraints problems that used to arise when doing "maven scarab:database" disappear if we set FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS=0 in src/sql/mysql/standard-mysql-init.sql 

 I've tested mysql-connector-3.0.10 with both MySQL 4.0.18 and 4.1, always in WinXP and seems to work fine. I have choosen this exact version because it's available in the maven repository in ibiblio.

Open issues:

* Licensing issues with mysql-connector: The driver is GPL... are we able to include it in www/repository and distribute it? It can be downloaded automatically by Maven but if we ran scarab:update-repo it will be included in our repo.

* Would anybody test it with MySQL 3.x?

* Testing, testing, testing...
