SCB1407 - Automatic Login in Windows
====================================

This branch is intended to provide the means for automatic login on
Windows networks.

The issue was started with code provided by Peter Nei, but it's been changed
to allow full identification even in browsers that will not support NTLM; in
those cases, a 'http basic' authentication dialog will be used.

It's implemented as a new valve in the pipeline (NtlmLoginValve), that
will try to get the credentials from the browser using the ntlm challenge
protocol.

== Behaviour ==

The NTLM login will be deactivated by default, and it will be activated
using a scarab property. The authentication domain for the whole scarab instance will
have to be provided too.

== Problems, doubts ==

Define the desired behaviour for Anonymous login and automatic login to live together.
If I want to be 'anonymous', I don't want the system to ask me for a user/password.

Should we *hide* the login form?
Will the 'logout' makes sense?
Is anonymous allowed in this setup?

== TODO ==

jcifs is LGPL, but it don't seem to exist a good-enough alternative library. Some apache projects
have been using it (Lenya) providing a mock jar to allow compiling, and asking the administrator
to manually download the real jar. This method should fit Scarab too, so I haven't 
uploaded (and won't do it) the jcifs jar to Scarab's maven repository. If any, we'll provide the
mock, but this must still be cleared up.
I guess using maven would solve this issue as long as we don't distribute the jar, but I fear this
will not be compatible with the new installer in progress (I suppose it's not supposed to require
internet connection to work!)
