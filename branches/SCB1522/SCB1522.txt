SCB1522: Problems when copying issues
==============================

* MoveIssue.java & MoveIssue2.vm
  - Difference between simple values and UserAttributes in the nonmatching lists.

* Issue.java
  - Improvements to check if a multivalued (UserAttribute) is contained in the nonmatching list.
  - UserAttributes / roles are checked to not be duplicated.
  - Comments about nonmatching userattributes are now more accurated.
  
* MoveIssue.vm
  - "Same module" refers now to the source module of the copied issue, and not to the user's currently selected module.
