<p>
Using <!-- TODO link --> Torque, 
Scarab is able to connect to many different database types.

</p>
<p>
Some of the difference between databases
cannot be completely handled using Torque, however.
</p>
<p>
One prime example is the initial data load.
The default date format recognized by Oracle
is inconsistent with the more commonly used date format
recognized by several other databases including MySQL.
</p>
<p>
Another example is the ability to select a constant
or a database function result separate from a database query.
MySQL allows the following syntax:
</p>
<p>
<pre>
    SELECT 1
</pre>
</p>
<p>
while Oracle requires a select statement to include a <code>from</code> clause,
and supplies a system table called <code>DUAL</code> which contains only
one row for use similar to the following:
</p>
<p>
<pre>
    SELECT 1 FROM DUAL
</pre>
